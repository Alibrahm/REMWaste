# Waste Management Skip Hire Website - Interview Submission

## üìå Project Overview
This submission presents a complete redesign of a Skip Hire product details page, built as a technical interview challenge. The primary objective was to create a **modern**, **responsive**, and **highly usable UI/UX** while maintaining full functionality.

---

## üé® Design & UI/UX Philosophy

The redesign prioritized a clean, intuitive, and visually engaging user experience. Key design decisions include:

- **Modern Aesthetic**: Dark theme with vibrant blue accents and subtle background textures.
- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Emphasis on pricing and skip features.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness**: Optimized for all screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Image gallery, quantity selector, accordions for structured content.
- **Promotional Highlighting**: Eye-catching banners for special offers and premium services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Why Next.js?
I chose **Next.js 14+ (App Router)** for several compelling reasons:

- **Performance Optimization**: Built-in SSR/SSG, image optimization, and code-splitting.
- **Developer Experience**: Flexible file-based routing and component architecture.
- **Built-in API Routes**: Perfect for seamless backend integrations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with production-grade applications.

## üßæ Types Setup (`src/types/index.ts`)

TypeScript was integrated from the start to improve maintainability and reduce runtime issues.

- **Clear Data Models**: Interfaces like `Skip`, `SearchResult`, `AddressDetails`.
- **Typed API Responses**: Ensures data structure consistency from APIs.
- **Improved DX**: Autocomplete, refactoring support, and early error detection.
- **Maintainability**: Types make it easier to debug, extend, and collaborate.
- Example: Adjusting `id?: string;` in `AddressDetails` to match external API formats.

---

## üèó Architectural Highlights

- **Component-Based**: Modular, reusable UI pieces for consistency and scalability.
- **Clear State Management**:
  - `useState`: Local UI interactions.
  - `React Hook Form`: Controlled form input state.
  - `SWR`: Efficient API data management.
  - `Zustand`: Shared client-side state (e.g., selected address).
- **Custom Hooks**:
  - `useAddressLookupSWR`: Live search with debounce.
  - `useDebounce`: Utility hook for optimized queries.
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Configured via `next.config.js` using `remotePatterns` for external images (e.g., Supabase).

---

## üîó API Integration

The app demonstrates real-world API usage through:

- **Postcode Anywhere API**: Address lookup & suggestions using `useAddressLookupSWR` and `useAddressRetrieveSWR`.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable to include live skip data from: https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location
